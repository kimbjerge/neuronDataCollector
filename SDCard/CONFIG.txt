%Configuration file for template matching
%Template - name of neuron template with the length of 16 samples and width of 8 channels
%Thres - threshold used to detect neuron activations after normalized cross correlation
%Min - minimum peak in signal to validate activation
%Max - maximum peak in signal to validate activation
%Cnt - only used for first template in list to specifiy JB9 digital output to go high 
%      the output is set high if template 1 and 2 in the list is seen within sample Cnt (3000 = 100 ms)
